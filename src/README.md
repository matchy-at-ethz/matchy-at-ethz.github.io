# Notes taken @ ETH Zurich

## Introduction

Here I list all courses I took at ETH Zurich and provide a brief overview of the course content. The clickable links will lead you to the respective course notes.

Courses are organized by semester and year. The course notes are organized by lecture.

### 22HS

- Computational Biology
- [Data Mining I](./22hs/dm1/data_mining_i.md)
- Information Systems for Engineers (Won't be covered here)
- Computational Systems Biology

### 23FS + HS

- [Mobile Health and Activity Monitoring](./23fs/mham/mobile_health_and_activity_monitoring.md)
- [Functional Genomics](./23fs/fg/functional_genomics.md)
- [Introduction to Machine Learning](./23fs/iml/introduction_to_machine_learning.md)
- Big Data for Engineers (Won't be covered here)

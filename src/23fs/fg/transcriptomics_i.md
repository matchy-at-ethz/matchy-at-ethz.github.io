### Pseudogenes

Sometimes a gene has an associated *retrotransposed* pseudogenes. They have
 almost the same sequence as the original gene, but they are not functional
 because they do not have access to promotors and thus won't be transcribed.
Usually they also contain more mutations because there are no selection
 pressures to keep them intact.

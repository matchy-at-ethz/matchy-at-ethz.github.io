## What is Machine Learning?

Given data, produce models that fulfill a certain task, gives predictions.

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised learning**: inputs has **labels** --> learns a *mapping* rule: classification*, "predicting next", re-mapping
  - classification: map to discrete scalars, binary ~ multiclass
  - regression: map to continuous scalars, the most "fitting a model" problem
    - linear regression, and alike (time series, etc)
  - structured prediction: complex output, e.g. map from A language to B language, semantic segmentation
- Unsupervised learning: no labels --> learng a rule for describing the data --> information retrieval, representation learning etc
  - clustering (measure similarity)
  - dimensionality reduction
  - generative models (learn reps, alternate reps --> new data)

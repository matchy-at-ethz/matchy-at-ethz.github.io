# Data Mining I

A course taught by [Prof. Karsten Borgwardt](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/borgwardt)

There used to be Data Minining I and II, but since 2022 fall was the last time this course was offered, I only took Data Mining I.

The course was _really_ well organized and the concepts were explained _really_ clear, but it's _not_ for beginners (students biological background) without solid mathematical foundation. My classmates with a biology background struggled a lot.
